\\
Hail King of Rohan, will you take my sword?
\\*
Staying here at home has got me really bored,
\\*
Knitting socks for soldiers is a waste of time,
\\*
Let me ride to war, ’cause I want to be a Rider of
Rohan.
\\*
\textit{Rider of Rohan}
\\
\\
I’m getting dirty looks from a dirty man,
\\*
And his evil master has a cunning plan.
\\*
I’ve got a sword, a spear and a coat of mail,
\\*
And I have no fear, and I want to be a Rider of Rohan.
\\*
\textit{Rider of Rohan}
\\
\\
You’ve got six thousand spears, what’s another one?
\\*
You’d have let me follow if I’d been your son,
\\*
A woman’s lot is not a happy one,
\\*
Won’t you change your rules, ’cause I want to be a Rider of Rohan.
\\*
\textit{Rider of Rohan}
\\
\\
Let me strike a blow in aid of women’s rights:
\\*
What you really need is some knights in tights.
\\*
If you do refuse me I’ll come anyway,
\\*
'Cause I want renown, and I want to be a Rider of Rohan
