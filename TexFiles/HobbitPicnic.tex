\section{A Picnic in the Forest}
Words by Arti Ponson.
\\
Tune ’The Teddybears’ Picnic’ by Bratton, Kennedy.
\\
\\
If you go down to the woods today
\\
be sure of a big surprise.
\\
If you go down to the woods today
\\
you’d better go in disguise.
\\
For every orc that ever there was
\\
will gather there for certain, because
\\
today’s the day the hobbits are having a picnic.
\\
\\
Every hobbit who’s out to lunch
\\
is sure of a threat today
\\
Every hobbit who’s had a lunch
\\
at home he did surely stay
\\
They’ll climb the trees or run without plan,
\\
they’ll hide and shriek as long as they can,
\\
for what’s the end the hobbit will see to their picnic.
\\
\\
If you go down to the woods today
\\
you’d better not go alone.
\\
It’s lovely down in the woods today
\\
but safer to stay at home.
\\
For every orc that ever there was
\\
will gather there for certain, because
\\
today’s the day the hobbits are having a picnic.
\\
\\
Picnic time, orcs lay their snares;
\\
the little hobbits are forming such an easy prey.
\\
(Just imagine) How they’re all caught unawares,
\\
it truly is an orcish holiday.
\\
See them gaily munch about;
\\
The hobbits scream and shout and scatter away in
fear.
\\
At six o’clock the wargs will be coming to clear away the bones,
\\
and that was that for another year.
\\
(So don’t forget:)
\\
\\
If you go down to the woods today
\\
you’d better not go alone.
\\
It’s lovely down in the woods today
\\
but safer to stay at home.
\\
For every orc that ever there was
\\
will gather there for certain, because
\\
today’s the day the hobbits are having a picnic
