\section{The Mushroom Song}
Words by Anna Bowles.
\\
\\
Frodo slipped from Brandy Hall
\\
But Prudence stayed behind
\\
He made for Farmer Maggot’s land
\\
With mushrooms on his mind.
\\
\\
Mushrooms, mushrooms!
\\
With mushrooms on his mind
\\
Though Prudence stayed at home in bed
\\
He’d mushrooms on his mind!
\\
\\
As soon as Frodo reached his goal
\\
Young Prudence leapt from bed,
\\
She bounded out across the fields
\\
And jumped inside his head.
\\
\\
Mushrooms, mushrooms!
\\
With mushrooms on his mind
\\
When Prudence jumped inside his head
\\
He’d mushrooms on his mind!
\\
\\
Prudence whispered soft to him
\\
“Mushrooms are good to eat,
\\
But Maggot’s seen you trespassing
\\
Your backside will be beat!”
\\
\\
Mushrooms, mushrooms!
\\
With mushrooms on his mind
\\
Maggot saw the trespasser
\\
With mushrooms on his mind!
\\
\\
The farmdogs caught our hero’s scent
\\
And soon they won the chase,
\\
For Frodo tried to leap a gate
\\
And fell upon his face.
\\
\\
Mushrooms, mushrooms!
\\
With mushrooms on his mind
\\
He tripped and fell upon his face
\\
He’d mushrooms on his mind!
\\
\\
Old Maggot beat and Frodo squeaked,
\\
His backside soon was sore,
\\
As Maggot whacked and hid a smile,
\\
And then he whacked some more!
\\
\\
Mushrooms, mushrooms!
\\
With mushrooms on his mind
\\
Maggot whacked and whacked some more
\\
He’d mushrooms on his mind!
\\
\\
It wasn’t till his seat was raw
\\
That Maggot let him go;
\\
Prudence simply watched and grinned
\\
And cried; “I told you so!”
\\
\\
Mushrooms, mushrooms!
\\
With mushrooms on his mind
\\
And even when his seat was raw
\\
He’d mushrooms on his mind!
\\
\\
For mushrooms are a noble food,
\\
And all I could desire
\\
Is frothing ale and mushroom pie
\\
Beside a warm inn’s fire.
