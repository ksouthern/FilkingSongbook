\\
\\
Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
\\
Of him the harpers sadly sing:
\\
the last whose realm was fair and free
\\
between the Mountains and the Sea.
\\
\\
His sword was long, his lance was keen,
\\
his shining helm afar was seen;
\\
the countless stars of heaven’s field
\\
were mirrored in his silver shield.
\\
\\
But long ago he rode away,
\\
and where he dwelleth none can say;
\\
for into darkness fell his star
\\
in Mordor where the shadows are.
\\
\\
The Last Alliance then was made
\\
of Elves and Men ’gainst Mordor’s shade;
\\
Gil-galad’s spear was in his hand
\\
for Aiglos’ might none could withstand.
\\
\\
At Dagorlad, the Battle Plain,
\\
a host of Men and Elves were slain;
\\
Elendil’s sword the battle won,
\\
it bore the light of moon and sun.
\\
\\
At Gorgoroth, as we hear tell,
\\
Gil-galad died, Elendil fell,
\\
but then Isildur forth did stand
\\
and cut the Ring from Sauron’s hand.
\\
\\
But Gil-galad has gone away,
\\
and where he dwelleth none can say;
\\
for into darkness fell his star
\\
in Mordor where the shadows are.
