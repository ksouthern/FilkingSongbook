There were Rings, Rings, and lots of funny things
\\
In the Shire, in the Shire –

There were Rings, Rings, and lots of funny things

I have not brought my Ring with me
\\
\\
There was Strider, Strider, tanking up on cider
\\
In the Shire, in the Shire –

There was Strider, Strider, tanking up on cider

I have not brought my Ring with me
