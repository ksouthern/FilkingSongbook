One my personal highlights of Oxonmoot is the moment in the bar (normally after the Masquerade) when someone pulls out a guitar and starts playing a filk. This is normally followed by at least one person shouting out "Wild Ranger" or another firm favourite, and a few people pulling out well thumbed copies of a song book. It also highlights who has been around at Oxonmoot for a while and who has only been to a few - only the former tend to know the songs.

So whether you've picked this up after hearing a song and not knowing the words, or if you've taken it to replace an older copy that's held together with cellotape, we hope you enjoy these songs and encourage you to write some of your own (and then to send them to us so that they can be in the next volume).
